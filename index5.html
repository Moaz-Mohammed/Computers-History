    <h1>Computer components refer to the various physical parts that make up a computer system, enabling it to function. These components can be broadly categorized into hardware and software:</h1>

<h2>Hardware Components:</h2>
<h5>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</h5> <p>Often referred to as the brain of the computer, the CPU performs most of the calculations and tasks essential to executing programs.</p> <br>
<h5>Motherboard:</h5> <p>This is the main circuit board of the computer to which all other components are connected. It provides the communication pathway between various components.</p> <br>
<h5>Random Access Memory (RAM):</h5> <p>RAM is volatile memory used by the computer to store data and program instructions temporarily while the system is running.</p> <br>
<h5>Storage Devices:</h5> <p> This includes hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and other storage media used to store data permanently.</p> <br>
<h5>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU):</h5> <p>Responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations, especially in tasks like gaming, video editing, and graphical design.</p>  <br>
<h5>Power Supply Unit (PSU):</h5> <p> Supplies electrical power to the components of the computer.</p> <br>
<h5>Cooling Systems:</h5> <p> Fans, heat sinks, and liquid cooling systems are used to dissipate heat generated by the CPU, GPU, and other components to prevent overheating.</p> <br>
<h5>Peripheral Devices:</h5> <p> Input and output devices such as keyboards, mice, monitors, printers, scanners, and external storage devices.</p> <br>
<h5>Expansion Cards:</h5> <p> Additional cards such as network interface cards (NICs), sound cards, and graphics cards that can be added to enhance the capabilities of the computer.</p> <br>
<h5>Cables and Connectors:</h5> <p> Various cables and connectors are used to interconnect different components of the computer.</p> <br>

<h2>Software Components:</h2>
<h5>Operating System (OS):</h5> <p>The primary software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs.</p> <br>
<h5>Device Drivers:</h5> <p>Software that enables communication between the operating system and hardware devices.</p> <br>
<h5>Utilities:</h5> <p> Additional software tools used for system maintenance, diagnostics, security, and other purposes.</p> <br>
<h5>Applications:</h5> <p> Software programs designed to perform specific tasks or functions, such as word processing, web browsing, gaming, etc.</p> <br>

<h2>These components work together to form a functional computer system, enabling users to perform various tasks and operations.</h2>
